database project for UV NF17

The SQL code is designed for Postgres DB and there is a small part of Sql request is missing, so you can't directly import the sql and expect that everything is ready, you should check all before running, ex. tables, columns name, etc.

A little demo is below, I'm still working to fix some issue due to the migration(Pg to Mysql!!).
